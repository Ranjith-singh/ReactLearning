Reactjs in basically a frontend framework that makes your project organized
React has 2 variants
    reactNative: for mobile based applications
    reactWeb: for web based applications
React individually doesn't perform very well
    but combined with other framework/libraries like "react-router-dom" and "redux" it makes more sense
you can create react app in 2 ways
    using react-create-app: uses all the react frameworks/libraries to create react app
        lots of unnecessary libs like monitoring stats, testing frameworks etc makes it slower
    using create vite@latest: imports only necessary frameworks which makes it faster
index.html acts as the main/starting page of application
all the functions are called in main.jsx in similar fashion to html ele tags
func should be written in a .jsx file as restricted by vite
the main part of using the .jsx is we can write html in a javascript file

Building a custom react app:
    react at the end of the day converts yours jsx functions into reactElement using the render function of react
    we can select the domElement to operate on which is the root element of the index.html
    we specify our own custom react element object with our own attributes
    we make our own customRender method that takes the reactElement to be appended to the root element
    react internally does the same thing for the func that returns jsx but it uses reacts own render method
        that allows its reactElement attributes of its own type not our custom one
        the jsx tag passed to the react.render internally executes the func which can be directly executed
        react doesn't allow you to create you own element you can create new element using the react.createElement()

projects:
    02counter:
        create a counter value that gets increamented and decremented using buttons
        in Javascript we should update the value and place them individually in the dom variable references
        in React we use hooks like useState() and useEffect() to reflect the updatedVariable in the entire dom
        instead of directly using the variable to update update using its prev state provided by react
            the react fiber when same type of increment is done on the counter thinks it as rewrite of update mistake and takes only one
    React createRoot():
        React uses the createRoot method to create a virtual dom in memory from the browser dom
        when the dom content is modified it creates a new dom and compares it with the virtual dom using diffing.
        the changes are propagated to virtual dom using the react fiber algo which uses some techniques for reconciliation:
            assign task priority, abort tasks and wait before update etc.
    03tailwindprops:
        tailwind is a utility function that internally uses the css for ui/ux
        you can create a component for a tailwind and pass the props obj for attribute insertion in tailwind component
        the component directly provides this props obj
    04bgChanger:
        uses set of colors present in div to change a color
    05passwordgenerator:
        this application generates password based on the length of input allowed which is toggled
            the truth values of the numbers and characters
        we use the useState hook to keep the states of each of these parameter and update accordingly
        we use the useEffect hook to monitor these parameters and trigger events based on change
        useCallBack hook to store the cache in memory for improved performance
        useRef hook to hold a reference of variable and discover all its functionalities
    06CurrencyConverter:
        create a custom hook which takes value from inputBox and based on the value calls the OnCurrencyChange
            which internally calls api based on the value passed and return obj contains currencyType: value
        create a inputBox component which takes various fields as through args and returns a inputBox jsx
            you can add hooks for storing states of variable and can also add useEffect on what args it should depend
            make sure to use html.for loops for keys to make it more efficient and get values in the form of array for easy functionality
        use these input box component and custom hooks inside App.jsx
    07ReactRouter:
        use react-router-dom to render different components based on different url
            use routerprovider and createBrowserRouter() to create route
            takes params: path and element to render
            you can also provide nested routes as well
        you can use RRD's outlet to provide paths based on varying urls and rest as constant for improved performance
        should use link and navlink from RRD instead of <a> cause the <a> re-renders the entire page which is not a concept of react
        also use useParams to get url based params and passed arg isActive to check which page they are on
        can use useLoaderData to load data on cursor hover which can be used instead of useEffect
            for improved performance
    08ThemeSwitcher:
        when we want to you any params to be used inside a nested component but don't want nested passing
            you can use contextApi which comes along with react
        createContext() is used to create contexts, then you need to wrap your components inside its contextProvider
            and specify the params obj which can be used
        now you can use this context using the useContext() from react around the component wrapped by contextProvider
    09TodoList:
        In this project we will use about ContextApi and localstorage
        you can create context api by using createContext() and useContext()
            and passing params through contextProvider encapsulating components
        useContext can be wrapped under a higher order function
        react lets you directly access browser's localstorage using localstorage obj
        localstorage takes values only in Strings
    reduxToolKitTodo:
        Here the contextApi works fine but to make it more encapsulating and singe score of truth
            we use redux
        redux is separate framework which can be used with react, Vue etc and to connect redux with react
            we use react-redux
        redux-toolkit: more refined and better version handles various edge cases
        their are mainly 4 things important about redux
            store: which acts as a single source of truth for data
            reducers: methods which helps in modifying the data stored in store/Slice
            useSelector: to select a particular element from store
            useDispatch: to push new value into the store
        you can create store using the configureStore() which needs reference to the reducer
        reducer is created inside the createSlice() which has a name, initialState and a reducer takes 2 params
            (state, action): state points to the initialState and action points to the request
        it also provide nanoid() for unique id generation
        export slice.reducer, action and slice itself for future use
        useDispatch provides payload to addData to dispatch
        useSelector takes both (state, action) params state referring to store and action to request
        now to use these values and reducers we encapsulate our components with react.provider
            but in here instead of directly passing the props we pass store which is single source truth
