Reactjs in basically a frontend framework that makes your project organized
React has 2 variants
    reactNative: for mobile based applications
    reactWeb: for web based applications
React individually doesn't perform very well
    but combined with other framework/libraries like "react-router-dom" and "redux" it makes more sense
you can create react app in 2 ways
    using react-create-app: uses all the react frameworks/libraries to create react app
        lots of unnecessary libs like monitoring stats, testing frameworks etc makes it slower
    using create vite@latest: imports only necessary frameworks which makes it faster
index.html acts as the main/starting page of application
all the functions are called in main.jsx in similar fashion to html ele tags
func should be written in a .jsx file as restricted by vite
the main part of using the .jsx is we can write html in a javascript file

Building a custom react app:
    react at the end of the day converts yours jsx functions into reactElement using the render function of react
    we can select the domElement to operate on which is the root element of the index.html
    we specify our own custom react element object with our own attributes
    we make our own customRender method that takes the reactElement to be appended to the root element
    react internally does the same thing for the func that returns jsx but it uses reacts own render method
        that allows its reactElement attributes of its own type not our custom one
        the jsx tag passed to the react.render internally executes the func which can be directly executed
        react doesn't allow you to create you own element you can create new element using the react.createElement()

projects:
    02counter:
        create a counter value that gets increamented and decremented using buttons
        in Javascript we should update the value and place them individually in the dom variable references
        in React we use hooks like useState() and useEffect() to reflect the updatedVariable in the entire dom
    React createRoot():
        React uses the createRoot method to create a virtual dom in memory from the browser dom
        when the dom content is modified it creates a new dom and compares it with the virtual dom using diffing.
        the changes are propagated to virtual dom using the react fiber algo which uses some techniques for reconciliation:
            assign task priority, abort tasks and wait before update etc.
    03tailwindprops:
        tailwind is a utility function that internally uses the css for ui/ux
        you can create a component for a tailwind and pass the props obj for attribute insertion in tailwind component
        the component directly provides this props obj
